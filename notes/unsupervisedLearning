Clustering properties

    - Richness: for any assignment of objects to the clusters, there is some distance matrix such that clustering scheme produces that scheme. All inputs are valid and anything could be an output. 
    - scale-invariant: scaling distances by a positive value does not change the clustering
    - consistency: shrinking intra-cluster distances and expanding intercluster distances does not change the clustering.
        + if you make things taht are similar more similar and things less similar less similar should not change clustering. 

Single link clustering stops when:

1. n/2 clusters reached
    - Richness: No. forced to always have n/2 clusters
    - scale-invariant: Yes. nothing cares about distances -> order not scale
    - consistency: Yes. Points that are clustered together will stay together if moved closer
2. clusters are theta units apart
    - Richness: Yes. Can do any unit, make any # of clusters for any number units
    - scale-invariant: No. 
    - consistency: Yes. Looking at distance between the clusters
3. clusters are theta/w units apart where w = max(d(i,j)) 
    - Richness: Yes.
    - scale-invariant: Yes. If you try to make things bigger, maximum distance gets bigger by same amount. Go back to where you were.
    - consistency: No. Clusters farther apart changes w. 

No tweak can be done to algos to get trifecta. Impossible to derive algorithm that cna give you all three. 
    - Impossiblity Theorem
    - Kleinberg
    - how bad is it?

What have we learned?
- clustering: the idea
- connection to compact description
- algorithms
    * k-means
    * SLC (terminates fast)
    * EM (soft clusters)
- clustering properties and impossiblity
